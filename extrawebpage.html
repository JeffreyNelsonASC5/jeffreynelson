                <h2>I love sports, whether it's playing the sports that I do or watching sports like baseball, basketball, soccer, football, or even hockey.  I've always been the most interested in baseball and ever since I was 7 or so I've wanted to see a regular-season game in every Major League Baseball stadium before I graduated high school.  This was a goal that took a lot of dedication as well as a lot of planning from my father.</h2>
                <h2>We finally completed this goal, after about 10 years and 32 stadiums because 2 teams built new stadiums, by seeing the Twins in Minnesota.  Some trips meant a lot of traveling like going all over the state of California to see the 5 teams in that state or simply taking one day off to go to Detroit and see the one team in the entire state play.  Not only have we been to all the stadiums but for the past 10 my dad and I have seen at least one game of Spring Training every year. </h2>
